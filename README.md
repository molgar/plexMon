Basic script to log and send alerts (using https://pushover.net) when content is watched on a Plex Media Server

#### To use:

 Replace the placeholders in the script with your Pushover Token, Pushover User Key, Plex Server IP, and Plex Server Port
 
 Replace log location with the one for your own platform. See  https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200250417-Plex-Media-Server-Log-Files

 Optionally add any users to the ignore alert list

 Schedule the script to run periodically
